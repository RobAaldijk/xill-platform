    <description>
Execute a single SQL query.
The connection parameter is optional, if not given the last created connection will be used.
The timeout parameter is optional. The default is set to 30 seconds. When the query takes longer than the given
timeout it will stop. A timeout of 0 means that there is no limit.
The return value of this construct depends on the type of query. If the query results in a result set it will return
an iterator that will iterate over every row in that set. If the query is an update, insert or delete query it
will return the number of affected rows.

If you want to pass a string containing a colon you could either escape the colon by preceding the colon with two
backslashes (\\\\:), or insert the string in an object and use named parameters (see below) with that object.
See an example of the latter solution in the code examples.

## Parameters
If your query requires input it is generally bad practice to use string concatenation to build your own queries.
The correct way to do this it by using parameterization. This you can do in two ways.

### Named Parameters
To create parameters that are labeled, you can use the colon-syntax.

SELECT * from table WHERE column = :name

If you do this, the parameters input has to be an object containing all the used parameter labels as keys.

### Ordered Parameters
An other way is to not use labels but order your list for input parameters.

SELECT * from table WHERE column = ? AND other = ?

If you use this syntax, your parameters input should be a list containing the same amount of elements as question marks.
