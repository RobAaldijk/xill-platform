* Specification: 
*   A nested foreach MUST iterate properly. (So the inner foreach is executed in each loop of the outer)
* Input: Two lists with both three elements and two counters with value 0
* Expected: Lists are not changed. The outer loop is executed 3 times. The inner loop is executed 3 times for each loop of the outer (3x3=9)
