<function>
    <description>
Wraps `text`, identifying words by a space character (" ").

If `wrapLongWords` is `true`, then words are split as well.
`width` specifies the number of characters after which the line is wrapped.
Leading spaces on a new line are stripped. Trailing spaces are not stripped.
