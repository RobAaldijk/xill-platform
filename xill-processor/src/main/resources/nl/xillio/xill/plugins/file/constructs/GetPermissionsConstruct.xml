    <description>
Fetch read/write/execute permissions for a specific file or folder on a group and user basis.
The output structure of this construct will be the same on all operating systems. It will output all the declared
permissions for the file. So __not__ the effective permissions (i.e. automatic inheritance of of the group/user tree).

                var path = "TestFile.txt";
                var testFile = File.openWrite(path);
