<function>
    <description>
Returns a new string based on `text` in which occurrences of the string `needle` have been replaced by the string `replacement`.
    </description>
	<parameterDescriptions>
		<parameterDescription parameterName="text">
The string that will be searched.
        </parameterDescription>
		<parameterDescription parameterName="needle">
The string that will be searched for.
        </parameterDescription>
		<parameterDescription parameterName="replacement">
The string that will replace the found needle(s).
        </parameterDescription>
		<parameterDescription parameterName="useRegex">
If set to `false` the function will treat `needle` and `replacement` as regular text. (default is 'true')
        </parameterDescription>
		<parameterDescription parameterName="replaceAll">
If set to `false` the routine will only replace the first occurrence of `needle`. (default is `true`)
        </parameterDescription>
		<parameterDescription parameterName="timeout">
The amount of time in milliseconds the construct is allowed to run. (default is 5000)
Set timeout to zero to let the function run without timeout.
This should only be altered when dealing with large source documents, the timeout is there to protect the system from hanging on invalid expressions.
        </parameterDescription>
	</parameterDescriptions>
	<longDescription>
The `needle` is by default interpreted as a regex pattern, so all special regex characters have to be escaped when used as a literal.
Also in `replacement` you can use the capture groups from `needle` as "$1", "$2", etc.
To use a literal "$" in `replacement`, you need to escape it like this: "\$".

See the regular expressions page for more about regular expression support in Xill IDE.
