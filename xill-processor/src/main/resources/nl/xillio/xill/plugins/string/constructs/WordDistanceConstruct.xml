<function>
    <description>
Returns a floating point number between 0 (no likeness) and 1 (identical), indicating how similar the `source` and `target` are.

This routine uses the Damereau Levenshtein distance to calculate the similarity.
If `relative` is set to `false`, then the absolute distance will be returned rather than a relative distance.

            <code>
                use System, String;

                System.print(String.wordDistance("boy", "boy"));                  // 1

                System.print(String.wordDistance("boys", "girl"));                // 0
                System.print(String.wordDistance("girls", "girlfriends"));        // 0.4545454545454546
                System.print(String.wordDistance("girls", "girlfriends", false)); // 6
