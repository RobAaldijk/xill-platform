Runs a command line application and returns the output of the process.

`arguments` must contain a valid path to an
executable file as the first value, optionally followed by zero or more command line arguments. These arguments should be specified
one by one. `directory` is the working directory where the command will be executed.

Returns an OBJECT variable containing:

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|`errors`|A string of error messages|
|`output`|A string of output lines|
|`runtime`|The runtime in milliseconds|
|`exitCode`|The exit code of the process|

            <header>
            In Windows you can execute a batch command by running `cmd.exe` with the `/C` parameter. The example below
            prints the word `test`.
            Example output: {"errors":"","output":"test\r\n","runtime":32,"exitCode":0}
            </header>
            <code>
                use System;

                var result = System.exec(["cmd.exe", "/C", "echo test"]);
                System.print(result);
            </code>

            Copying a file in a specified working directory. In this specific example,
            the working directory is specified as `C:/tmp`. The file `source.jpg` is copied and
            the name of the new file is `target.jpg`. The copy, i.e. `target.jpg`, is created in the
            specified working directory, in this case `C:/tmp`.

            Example output: {"errors":"","output":"        1 file(s) copied.\r\n","runtime":40,"exitCode":0}.
