            <header>
            Copying a file in a specified working directory. In this specific example,
            the working directory is specified by C:/tmp. The source file source.jpg is copied and
            the name of the new file is target.jpg. The copy, i.e. target.jpg, is created in the
            specified working directory, in this case C:/tmp.

            Possible output: {"errors":[],"output":["        1 file(s) copied."],"runtime":19,"exitCode":0}.
