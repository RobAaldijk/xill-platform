<function>
    <description>
Convert a string representing hexadecimal values into string of those same values. The returned string will be
(at most) half the length of the passed array, as it takes at least two characters to represent any given byte.
Some character sets use double bytes to represent diacritic characters.

An error occurs if the passed `hexString` has an odd number of characters or contains an illegal hexadecimal character.
