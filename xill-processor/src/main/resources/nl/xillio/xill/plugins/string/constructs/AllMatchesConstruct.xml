<function>
    <description>
Returns a list with all substrings matching `regex`.

Optionally a timeout can be provided in seconds, the default value is 5 seconds.
Set timeout to zero to let the function run without timeout.
This should only be altered when dealing with large source documents, the timeout is there to protect the system from hanging on invalid expressions.
See the regular expressions page for more about regular expression support in Xill IDE.
