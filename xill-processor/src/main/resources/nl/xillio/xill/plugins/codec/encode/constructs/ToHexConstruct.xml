<function>
    <description>
Converts a string into a string of characters representing the hexadecimal values of each byte in order. Some character
sets use double bytes to represent diacritic characters. You can use the `toLowerCase` parameter to convert the
resulting string to lower case.

The returned string will be at least double the length of the passed string, as it takes (a multiple of) two characters
to represent any given character.
