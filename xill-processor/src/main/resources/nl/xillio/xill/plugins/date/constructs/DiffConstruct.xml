| centuries      | The whole amount of centuries in the difference after subtraction of `millennia` |
| decades        | The whole amount of decades in the difference after subtraction of `centuries`   |
| years          | The whole amount of years in the difference after subtraction of `decades`       |
| months         | The whole amount of months in the difference after subtraction of `years`        |
| weeks          | The whole amount of weeks in the difference after subtraction of `months`        |
