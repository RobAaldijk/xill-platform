<function>
    <description>
Returns the difference between two dates.  

By default this function will return the absolute difference.  
Optionally you can set 'absolute' to false to get the relative difference.

Everything prefixed with total will give the difference in the specified suffix,
e.g. 1 hour is the same as 60 minutes, 3600 seconds, etc.
All other properties together form the total difference, e.g. 25.05 hours = 1 day, 1 hour and 3 minutes (see the code example).
