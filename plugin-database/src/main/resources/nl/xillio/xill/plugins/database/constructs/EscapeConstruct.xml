<function>
	<description>
Escapes a string and returns it.  

The escaping depends on the database type, so in order to escape a string a connection to a database must first be established.

	<examples>
		<example title="Usage">
			<header>Escaping a string.</header>
			<code>
				use System;
				use Database;

				var con = Database.connect("database.sqlite", "sqlite");

				var unescaped = "This is an \"unescaped\" string.\n\tIt contains 'special' characters.";
				var escaped = Database.escape(unescaped);

				System.print(escaped);
				// This will print: This is an \"unescaped\" string.\n\tIt contains \'special\' characters.
				// Note how the newline and tab are not printed as such, but as their string counterpart (the literals "\n" and "\t").
			</code>
