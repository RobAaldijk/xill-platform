<function>
    <description>
Sets the focus to the given `element` of a web page.

This is used as a replacement for `mouseover` and `mouseout` events in the absence of a mouse.
Some pages require these events to be triggered to load data for combo-boxes, menus or other dynamic elements.

    <examples>
        <example title="Usage">
            <header>Set focus on an element on a web page</header>
            <code>
use Web;
use System;

var page = Web.loadPage ("http://www.xillio.com/");

if (page != null) {
    // select the link to the main page
    var node = Web.xPath(page, '//a[@href="http://www.xillio.com/partners"]');

    // simulate the mouse triggering a mouseover java script event
    if( node != null) {
        Web.focus(node);

        // mouseout event from this node would be triggered at the next
        // focus(...) call for a different node
    }
    else {
        System.print("No matching node found");
    }
} else {
