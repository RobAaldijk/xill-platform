    <description>
When a workbook contains formulas and the source cells are updated, then the workbook is not automatically updated with
the new calculated value. `Excel.recalculate` scan the workbook for changed cell values and modifies the results of the
formulas accordingly.
    </description>
	<parameterDescriptions>
        <parameterDescription parameterName="workbook">
The workbook to be recalculated.
        </parameterDescription>
	</parameterDescriptions>
	<longDescription>
The library used is an emulation of Excel. It is not using Excel itself. Doing a recalculation of a workbook can run
 into errors like missing functions, unexpected loop holes, etc.
If this happens this function should not be used. Recalculating should then be done Excel.

    <examples>
        <example title="Usage">
            <header>Recalculating the current workbook</header>
            <code>
                use Excel ;
                var workbook = Excel.createWorkbook("formulas.xlsx");
                var sheet = Excel.createSheet(workbook, "formulaSheet");
                Excel.setCellValue(sheet, "A", 1, 2);
                Excel.setCellValue(sheet, "B", 1, 4);
                Excel.setCellFormula(sheet, "C", 1, "SUM(A1:B1)");
                Excel.recalculate(workbook);
                Excel.save(workbook);
            </code>
            <header format="MD">
`GEOMEAN` is an unknown function in the Excel plugin. Recalculating the workbook will run into an error: `Workbook
contains unknown function 'GEOMEAN' in cell formulaSheet!C1`. In this case you have to open the workbook in Excel and do
the recalculation there.
