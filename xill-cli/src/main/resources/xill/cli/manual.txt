Usage
=====

This program executes .xill scripts from the command line. If neither the -v or -h options are specified, this program
will execute every robot that is passed as an argument.

Run Test.xill:

    xill Test

It is also possible to address a robots with more complex fully qualified names:

    xill fully.qualified.Name


Input and Output Streams
========================

The input, output and error streams are exposed to robots through the 'argument' keyword. You can use the 'Stream' plugin
to read from the input and write to the output and error stream.

For Example:

    use Stream;

    // This argument will contain the streams
    argument std;

    // Write a line to the output
    Stream.write("-------------\n", std.output);

    // Copy all input to the output
    Stream.write(std.input, std.output);

    // Write another line to the output
    Stream.write("-------------\n", std.output);


The script above can be used by piping data into the command:

    echo "Hello World!" | xill MyRobot
