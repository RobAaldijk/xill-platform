Temporarily store a decorator definition in cache.

A decorator defines a set of fields, their types and whether they are mandatory or not. A content type is defined as
a set of these decorators. Any document stored in the Universal Data Model, must specify a content type, which is then
used to check if all decorator constraints are met.

This construct will not push and persist the definition. This should be done using the `ContentType.save()` construct.
Every field inside the decorator must contain 3 values: the name, the type and the optionality. In the examples
below you can see how to build up these decorators.

The identity parameter determines which decorator cache will be used and to which database the decorators will be saved
when `ContentType.save()` is called. For example, when identity is `default`, the `udm_default` database will be used.

Supported decorator types: BOOLEAN, STRING, NUMBER, DATE, LIST
