The string that will be used to connect to the database.

	</parameterDescriptions>
	<longDescription>
To connect to SQLite you need to provide a connection string that contains all the required information.
The simple format of the connection string is:

    jdbc:sqlite:[database_specifier]

The default behavior is to locate the file at the path of in the url and use it as a database. The preferable way to locate your database is by using an abstract path.

    jdbc:sqlite:C:/tmp/sqlite.db

If you do not want to save your database you can simply create an in-memory database.
*Note the double colon after sqlite*

    jdbc:sqlite::memory:

You can also access your database from an external resource using a url.

    jdbc:sqlite:resource:http://example.com/sqlite.db

            <code>
                use SQLite as db;

                db.connect("jdbc:sqlite::memory:");

                // Now you can use the SQLite constructs
                // To interact with the database
